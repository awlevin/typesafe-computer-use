# Writer endpoints

The writer types text, proposes URLs, and reads the screen whenever the classifier stops. By
default it is Claude on `api.anthropic.com`. These variables change the model or send it to
another endpoint.

| variable | required | purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `CLICKER_WRITER_BASE_URL` | no | send the writer to another endpoint; unset means `api.anthropic.com` |
| `CLICKER_WRITER_API_KEY` | no | the key for `CLICKER_WRITER_BASE_URL`, if it checks one |
| `CLICKER_WRITER_API` | no | what that endpoint speaks: `anthropic` (the default) or `openai` |
| `CLICKER_WRITER_MODEL` | no | types text and proposes URLs; defaults to `claude-haiku-4-5` |
| `CLICKER_ANSWER_MODEL` | no | reads the screen whenever the classifier stops; defaults to `claude-sonnet-5` |
| `CLICKER_WRITER_VISION` | no | `false` for an answer model that reads text only; defaults to `true` |

## Other models

Point `CLICKER_WRITER_BASE_URL` at any endpoint that speaks the Anthropic
Messages API or, with `CLICKER_WRITER_API=openai`, OpenAI's Chat Completions API: LM Studio,
Ollama, vLLM, a LiteLLM proxy, DeepSeek. Name the models it serves. The full request URL works as
well as the root; for the OpenAI API keep the `/v1`. Such an endpoint may ignore structured-output
parameters, so the schema is also spelled out in the prompt, and code fences or a sentence around
the JSON are tolerated. On the OpenAI API a `json_schema` response format is asked for first, then
`json_object`, then none, stepping down only when the endpoint refuses one. Thinking is turned off,
since a model that thinks by default spends the writer's small token budgets on it and returns no
text. The answer model reads a screenshot; for a model that reads text only, set
`CLICKER_WRITER_VISION=false` and it gets the screen's text alone. A reply that cannot be read
refuses the step it was for, and the run goes on.

Keys never cross over: `CLICKER_WRITER_API_KEY` goes only to `CLICKER_WRITER_BASE_URL`, and
`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` and `OPENAI_API_KEY` never go there. On the Anthropic API it is sent in both
the `x-api-key` and `Authorization` headers, since proxies differ. Leave it empty for an endpoint
that checks no key.
